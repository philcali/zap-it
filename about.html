            <p>This game is dedicated to a former co-worker of mine at [LSU](http://lsu.edu/). </p>
            <p>We've worked side by side for almost 5 years, and even longer if you include university days. The game was made to be a tribute to that time, and be a reference point to his departure to pursue his dreams. </p>

            <p>We all worked at LSU. We liked video games. We had fun. We are all bro's. Adam was (is still) a part of that group, and contributed to the good times during the work day's slow progress. </p>

            <p>Adam has left LSU to pursue contract work for a Bible publishing company, named [Crossway](http://www.crossway.org/). Our loss is their gain. </p>
            <p>There is no doubt in my mind that Adam will be successful. At Crossway, he can be passionate about two very important things to him: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Python devlopment</li>
              <li>Jesus</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thankfully, he will not require re-location, but there will be an empty seat in this cubicle during the day. A constant reminder that our friend has moved on. </p>
