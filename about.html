            <p>This game is dedicated to a former co-worker at <a  href="http://lsu.edu/">LSU</a>, Adam
Zapletal.
</p><p>We've worked side by side for almost 5 years, and even longer if you include
university days. The game was made to be a tribute to that time, and be a
reference point to his departure to pursue his dreams.
</p><p>Adam's favorite video games is probably the original Megaman series in a
certain number sequence, so I thought it would be appropriate to send him
off with a very difficult Megaman-style platformer. It's a very truncated
experience, and probably filled with bugs. I hope it doesn't crash on you.

            <p>We all worked at LSU. We liked video games. We had fun. We are all bro's. Adam was (is still) a part of that group, and contributed to the good times during the work day's slow progress. </p>

            <p>Adam has left LSU to pursue contract work for a Bible publishing company,
named <a  href="http://www.crossway.org/">Crossway</a>. Our loss is their gain.
</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Adam will be successful. At Crossway, he can be
passionate about two very important things to him:
</p><ol><li>Python development
</li><li>Jesus
</li></ol><p>Thankfully, he will not require re-location, but there will be an empty seat
in this cubicle during the day. A constant reminder that our friend has moved
on.

quick:
</p><p>As a programmer: great. As a friend: better. Will you be missed at LSU?
Absolutely. You're entering a new, exciting chapter in your career, and I'm
very happy for you.
</p><p>I'm looking forward to hearing about your great successes.
</p><p>Good luck, dude. <img alt="pcali1"  src="data/images/pcali1.png"></img> <img alt="adamzap"  src="data/images/adamzap.png"></img>
