# Zap-IT!

[Adam Zapletal][adamzap] left LSU on the 7th of June, and this game was created
in the two weeks after he announced his resignation.

## Installation

If you want to quickly play it locally, then I recommend going the NodeJS
route.

- nodeJS
- `npm install -g coffee-script`
- `npm install express`
- `./serve`

You should be able to play it by going to http://localhost:8000/

## Megaman style bits

I ran out of time for a lot of the ideas I had, but the Megaman style game
work is already laid out, and largely pluggable to be used for anything.
